This is the report of the course project of EI339 Artificial Intelligence, concerning the problem of multiple object tracking. Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) is a pragmatic
approach to multiple object tracking with a focus on simple,
effective algorithms. Deep SORT integrates appearance information to improve the performance of SORT. \\
In this paper, we studied and re-implemented the Deep SORT method, and proposed some improvements to it.

\section{Introduction}

This is the report of the course project of EI339 Artificial Intelligence. We should admit that it is not one of publishable quality, although we paid a lot, e.g., writing the report in publishable format.

Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) plays an important role in solving many fundamental problems in video analysis and
computer vision. Its main task is to find and identify moving objects in a sequence of images. Depending on how objects are initialized, the strategies of MOT can be classified into two sets: Detection-Based Tracking (DBT) and Detection-Free Tracking (DFT), of which the first one is the mainstream of research. The DBT methods employ two steps: Objection Detection and Data Association, i.e., detecting objects of interest in each frame of a video first and then obtrain the tracks of the detected objects across frames according to their correspondence. 

Deep SORT \cite{Wojke2017simple} is an extension to Simple Real time Tracker (SORT) \cite{Bewley2016_sort}, and is one of the most popular and the most widely used object tracking frameworks. It achieved competitive performance with simple and elegent ideas, and can act as a baseline in the field of MOT. In this project, we are asked to study and re-implement the classical Deep SORT algorithm and achieve some improvements based on the Deep SORT framework.

\section{Conclusion}

In this project, we dove into the field of Multiple Object Tracking (MOT). It is both interesting and challenging. Our work is based on the credible Deep SORT method. We presented ...
