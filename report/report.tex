\begin{abstract}
This is the report of the course project of EI339 Artificial Intelligence, concerning the problem of multiple object tracking. Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) is a pragmatic
approach to multiple object tracking with a focus on simple,
effective algorithms. Deep SORT integrates appearance information to improve the performance of SORT. \\
In this paper, we studied and re-implemented the Deep SORT method, and proposed some improvements to it.

\section{Introduction}

This is the report of the course project of EI339 Artificial Intelligence. We should admit that it is not one of publishable quality, although we paid a lot, e.g., writing the report in publishable format.

\section{Studying Deep Sort}

Haha.
